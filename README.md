The Friends of Inform 6 Extensions Group
==========

Here you'll find many Inform 6 extensions -- These are tested and ready for public use.  All of them are acceptable for redistribution.

Some of these extensions are taken from the Inform 6 library contributions section [Interactive Fiction Archive](http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXcompilersXinform6XlibraryXcontributions.html).  Others originate here.  The overarching goal for this group is to select the best and keep them up to date.

If you would access to the repository to add your own extensions, please ask here: [http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=17230](http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=17230)

If you find a bug in any of these extensions, or indeed in any Inform 6 extension at all, please make a new issue and we may be able to help. The purpose of the group is that we can all work together to maintain and develop these extensions. Sharing the load will make it easier on us all, while experienced programmers can help those just starting out.
